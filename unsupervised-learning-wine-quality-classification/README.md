# Unsupervised Learning for White Wine Quality Grouping

## Overview
This project applies unsupervised learning techniques to uncover natural groupings in white wine samples based on their physicochemical properties. Using a dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality), we explore feature structures, apply dimensionality reduction, and perform clustering.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [UCI Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality)  
- **Features:** Various chemical properties (e.g., acidity, alcohol content, sulfur dioxide levels)

## Methodology
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding feature distributions and relationships.
2. **Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, feature scaling, and balancing via SMOTE (for enhanced feature space coverage).
3. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Application of PCA, and t-SNE for visualization.
4. **Clustering**: Implementation and comparison of clustering methods.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessment of clustering structure using silhouette scores and visualizations.
