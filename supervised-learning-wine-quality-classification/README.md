# Binary Classification of White Wine Quality Using Supervised Learning

## Overview
This project applies supervised learning techniques to classify the quality of white wine based on its physicochemical properties. Using a dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality), we explore feature relationships, apply machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [UCI Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality)  
- **Target Variable:** Wine quality (converted into a binary classification problem)
- **Features:** Various chemical properties (e.g., acidity, alcohol content, sulfur dioxide levels)

## Methodology
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding data distribution and feature correlations.
2. **Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, feature engineering, and balancing using SMOTE.
3. **Modeling**: Comparison of supervised learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM).
4. **Evaluation**: Model performance assessment using cross-validation and relevant metrics.
